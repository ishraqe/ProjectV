## Description

select * from life where days= happy;

I'm woking in this project in latest three days cause I wanted to learn more and apply my knowleage in laravel, it's a CMS for a blog that u can create, edit and delete. I hope u like it, if u want to make changes just do it haha. 

## About the project

I used Jquery, Bootstrap and Laravel.

There are six models such as Album, Photo, Category, Post, Profile and User.

The album has many pictures as post belongs to a category and inside each of the models there is a relation with an user.

So if u want to make a filter by user, u can.

Another interesting thing is that it's responsive but nothing is perfect I was working and I found a problem with images, so what's the problem? 

Well, the problem is how to crop images with php, I tried many things but nothing happened, if you have an answer for my question I will really appreciate to listen.

Thanks
